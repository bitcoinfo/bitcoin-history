The organizations are listed roughly in order of when they got involved with blockchain. 

I'm sure to have missed a few things. Please leave an issue, pull request, or contact me if there's anything you'd like included.

Off the top of my head: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stellar and IOTA have worked w UN. Eventually each may have its own section, as well.

Check out this collection's companion article:

## Early History

* 2010, the UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development [CSTD] proposed the introduction of [a technology-driven universal currency](http://unctad.org/Sections/wcmu/docs/ecn162010_Israel_en.pdf). A “BitMint” would allow users to transmit funds globally and carry them around on a usb stick.

  * “to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner.” 
  * Prominently among the agenda’s goals is providing identification to the world, by 2030.

While the Agenda doesn't explicitly mention the words blockchain or distributed ledger, the SDGs have been at the heart of the UN's interest in blockchain.

## UNRISD Report

In February of 2016, the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) published a report titled “[How Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance?](http://www.unrisd.org/brett-scott)” The report discusses how Bitcoin could empower those in developing nations:
>* Bitcoin as a means to facilitate low-cost remittances for those seeking to transfer small amounts of money internationally.
>* Bitcoin as a means for an otherwise excluded individual to have a decentralized global bank account, accessible simply by downloading an open source wallet from the internet, rather than having to set up with a formal financial institution.
>* Bitcoin—or the technology that underpins it—subsequently providing the basis for a richer set of financial services.
