## Verifying PGP Signatures

So this is an absolute fundamental of cryptography, and should be a part of everyone's skill-set. However, when you start to use PGP from the command-line, the first time... erm. I'll save my rant on that for later.

### Keybase

  >Keybase is a new and free security app for mobile phones and computers. For the geeks among us: it's open source and powered by public-key cryptography.

  >Keybase is for anyone. Imagine a Slack for the whole world, except end-to-end encrypted across all your devices. Or a Team Dropbox where the server can't leak your files or be hacked.

## Phil Zimmerman

* [Crypto Wars, Phil Zimmermann and PGP](https://cryptoanarchy.wiki/events/90s-crypto-wars)
  > Phil Zimmermann was a key player in this period. The PGP software he authored was considered as munitions by the US government and subject to export licenses. The US government at this time was keen to avoid strong crypto falling into the hands of civilians and foreign governments. At this time the US government was also pushing for specialised key-escrowed chips that would perform encryption, but make the plaintext readable to NSA if necessary. This was rightly considered a gross violation of privacy, rights, and a huge security hole by the cypherpunks.

* [Defending the last missing pixels: Phil Zimmermann speaks out on encryption, privacy, and avoiding a surveillance state](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/defending-the-last-missing-pixels-phil-zimmermann/)
  >Since writing the PGP encryption software in the 1990s, Phil Zimmermann has been a key figure in the internet privacy debate. With that argument heating up again, his perspective is more relevant than ever.

  >In addition to using encryption, standing up to surveillance requires fighting politically for a reduction in the amount of data collected on us, but the essential first step is to protect yourself and make surveillance of your communication as difficult as possible. This guide helps you do that. It is designed for beginners, but if you already know the basics of GnuPG or are an experienced free software user, you'll enjoy the advanced tips and the guide to teaching your friends.
