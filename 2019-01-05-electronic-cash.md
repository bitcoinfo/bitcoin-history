from Buniskey's Cryptoassets 

> "One of Bitcoin’s most famous ancestors was pioneered by a company called DigiCash, led by David Chaum, who remains one of the most famous cryptographers in crypto­ asset history. In 1993, prior to Marc Andressen founding Netscape, Chaum invented the digital payment system called ecash. This allowed secure and anonymous payments across the Internet, no matter the amount. 3 Clearly, Chaum’s timing could not have been better given the tech boom that followed through the mid- to late-1990s, and his company, DigiCash, had several opportunities for growth, any of which might have made it a household name. However, while Chaum was widely regarded as a technical genius, as a businessperson he left much to be desired. Bill Gates approached Chaum about integrating ecash into Windows 95, which would have immediately given it global distribution, but Chaum refused what was rumored to be a $100 million offer. Similarly, Netscape made initial inquiries about a relation- ship, but management was quickly turned off by Chaum’s attitude. In 1996, Visa wanted to invest $40 million into the company but were dissuaded when Chaum demanded $75 million (if these reports are correct, it’s clear that the potential price for Chaum’s creation was dropping). 4 If all had gone well, DigiCash’s ecash would have been integrated into all our web browsers at the ground floor, serving as the global Internet payment mechanism and potentially removing the need for credit cards in online payments. Sadly, mismanagement ultimately ran DigiCash into the ground, and in 1998 it declared bankruptcy. While DigiCash failed to become a household name, some players will resurface in our story, such as Nick Szabo, the father of “smart contracts,” and Zooko Wilcox, the founder of Zcash, both of whom worked at DigiCash for a time. 5:

  * In 1994, FirstVirtual offered online payments, like paypal, via e-mail.
  * 1994 - CyberCash - utilizing SET architecture to provide micro-payments
    > Secure electronic transaction (SET) was an early protocol for electronic credit card payments. As the name implied, SET was used to facilitate the secure transmission of consumer credit card information via electronic avenues, such as the Internet. SET blocked out the details of credit card information, thus preventing merchants, hackers and electronic thieves from accessing this information. -[investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secure-electronic-transaction-set.asp)

  > Secure methods of payment are needed before we will see widespread commercial use of the Internet. Recently proposed and implemented payment methods follow one of three models: electronic currency, credit-debit, and secure credit card transactions. Such payment services have different strengths and weaknesses with respect to the requirements of security, reliability, scalability, anonymity, acceptability, customer base, reliability, convertibility, efficiency, ease of integration with applications, and ease of use. NetCheque and NetCash are payment systems under development at the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California. NetCheque and NetCash are described and their strengths with respect to these requirements are discussed.

### Liberty Reserve

  > About 1 million users worldwide, including 200,000 in the U.S.; 55 million transactions; and $6 billion in ill-gotten gains.
  > 
  > Those are the numbers defining the case of Liberty Reserve, a digital currency and online payment service incorporated in Costa Rica in 2006. On Tuesday, an indictment was unsealed showing that seven men have been charged with running the unlicensed Liberty Reserve as a "bank of choice for the criminal underworld." According to The Wall Street Journal, "The system allegedly was designed to give criminals a way to move money earned from credit-card fraud, online Ponzi schemes, child pornography and other crimes without being detected by law enforcement." Five of the seven men are in custody, having been arrested on Friday in Spain, Costa Rica and Brooklyn, N.Y. Extradition will be sought for the suspects who are overseas; the other two remain at large.
  > 
  > For the first time, officials invoked the post-9/11 Patriot Act to shut down a virtual currency when they cut off Liberty Reserve from the U.S. financial system. The drastic measure comes at a time when digital alternatives to traditional currencies such as Bitcoin are drawing wider interest from the public.

  > Two other men involved in the business were sentenced to shorter jail terms.
  > Two more people will be sentenced on 13 May.

## 💰 Karma

* [Karma: Secure Economic Framework for Peer-to-Peer Resource Sharing](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/papers/karma.pdf)   
> Peer-to-peer systems are typically designed around the assumption that all peers will willingly contribute resources to a global pool. They thus suffer from freeloaders, that is, participants who consume many more resources than they contribute. In this paper, we propose a general economic framework for avoiding freeloaders in peer-to-peer systems. Our system works by keeping track of the resource consumption and resource contribution of each participant. The overall standing of eachparticipant in the system is represented by a single scalar value, called their karma. A set of nodes, called a bankset, keeps track of each node’s karma, increasing it as resources are contributed, and decreasing it as they are consumed. Our framework is resistant to malicious attemptsby the resource provider, consumer, and a fraction of the members of the bank set. We illustrate the application of this framework to a peer-to-peer filesharing application
