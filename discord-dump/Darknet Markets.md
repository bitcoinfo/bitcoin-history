    Until it was busted this week, an Internet drug ring doing business in 34 countries, all 50 states and the District of Columbia, eluded law enforcement by using TOR, an encrypted computer network developed for--and used by--the federal government.

    U.S. and international authorities have taken down an online drug ring, known as "The Farmer's Market," which used TOR IP-masking software to conceal the operation.

        [https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/08/06/black-market-drug-site-silk-road-booming-22-million-in-annual-mostly-illegal-sales/#4a253dbe5962](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/08/06/black-market-drug-site-silk-road-booming-22-million-in-annual-mostly-illegal-sales/#4a253dbe5962)

    According to the Farmer's Market indictment, however, that site sold around $1 million worth of illegal drugs between January of 2007 and October of 2009. With Silk Road generating close to twice that amount in a mere month, its operation has reduced its recently-busted competitor to a street-corner hustler by comparison.

    A 66-page federal indictment, unsealed Monday, alleged that the marketplace had processed more than 5,000 drug orders between January, 2007 and October, 2009, bringing in gross profits of $1 million. The money was allegedly collected using PayPal, Western Union, I-Golder, and Pecunix, as well as via cash. According to the indictment, the eight defendants "screened all sources of supply and guaranteed delivery of the illegal drugs," and handled all communications between buyers and sellers, in return receiving a commission based on the total value of each order.

    ...

    All of the defendants have been charged with money laundering, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, for which they could face life imprisonment. Alleged ringleaders Willems and Evron, meanwhile, were also charged with "participating in a continuing criminal enterprise," which carries a minimum sentence of 20 years, and a maximum of life imprisonment. The two men--as well as Rawls and the two Colbecks--were also charged with distributing LSD, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

    Privacy on the Internet

    The World Wide Web is rapidly becoming an important tool for modern day communication and electronic commerce. But electronic messages sent over the Internet can be easily snooped and tracked, revealing who is talking to whom and what they are talking about. Is privacy important, and how can it be guaranteed? This paper describes how a freely available system, onion routing, can be used to provide privacy for a wide variety of Internet services, including Virtual Private Networks, Web browsing, e-mail, remote login, and electronic cash.

    Abstract. This paper describes anarchitecture, Onion Routing, that limits a network's vulnerability to tracanalysis.The architecture provides anonymous socket connections by means of proxy servers. It provides real-time, bi-directional, anonymous communication for any protocol that can be adapted to use a proxy service. Specifically, the architecture provides for bi-directional communication even though noone but the initiator's proxy server knows anything but previous and next hops in the communication chain. This implies that neither the respondent nor his proxy server nor any external observer need know the identity of the initiator or his proxy server. A prototype of Onion Routing has been implemented. This prototype works with HTTP (WorldWideWeb) proxies. In addition, ananalogous proxy forTELNET has been imple-mented.ProxiesforFTPandSMTPareunderdevelopment.

    Tor began gaining popularity among activists and tech-savvy users interested in privacy, but it was still difficult for less-technically savvy people to use, so starting in 2005, development of tools beyond just the Tor proxy began. Development of Tor Browser began in 2008.

    >

    With Tor Browser having made Tor more accessible to everyday internet users and activists, Tor was an instrumental tool during the Arab Spring beginning in late 2010. It not only protected people's identity online but also allowed them to access critical resources, social media, and websites which were blocked.

    >

    The need for tools safeguarding against mass surveillance became a mainstream concern thanks to the Snowden revelations in 2013. Not only was Tor instrumental to Snowden's whistleblowing, but content of the documents also upheld assurances that, at that time, Tor could not be cracked.

    "I imagine that someday I may have a story written about my life."

        In one 2010 journal entry, Ulbricht said he thought up the idea for Silk Road (which he originally called "Underground Brokers") while working as an editor of scientific journals. He decided to get people interested in the site by producing and selling "several kilos of high quality shrooms" that he himself had grown in a lab — a very risky endeavor that he wouldn't repeat: "I was a hair's breadth from going to jail before the site even launched for growing shrooms," he wrote in his journal.

    >

    Ulbricht's entry said he sold 10 pounds of shrooms over those first few months, handling the transactions by hand. The site soon became so popular, however, that he had to rewrite it to include automatic payment features and tumblers to mask the IP addresses of buyers and sellers, according to the journal entry. He also wrote that he had to create an independent Silk Road server and hire employees to help him handle the site's explosion in traffic. He admitted in his journal that his relationship with his then girlfriend, Julia, suffered as he tried to keep up with the site's rather unexpected popularity.

    By 2010, Ulbricht had turned away from materials science and academia and announced on LinkedIn that he would be "creating an economic simulation to give people a firsthand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force," by which he seemed to mean police and laws. Around the same time, according to federal prosecutors, he was consulting a guidebook called The Construction & Operation of Clandestine Drug Laboratories and had built a DIY "shroomery" at a remote cabin in Texas to grow hallucinogenic fungi that would be the first product he was going to sell through his economic "experiment."

    Ross earned a scholarship to the University of Texas at Dallas and majored in physics. From there he landed a graduate scholarship at Penn State, where he excelled as usual. But he wasn’t happy with the drudgery of lab research. Since college he’d been exploring psychedelics and reading Eastern philosophy. At Penn State, Ross talked openly about switching fields. He posted online about his disenchantment with science—and his new interest in economics.

    >

    He’d come to see taxation and government as a form of coercion, enforced by the state’s monopoly on violence. His thinking was heavily influenced by Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, a totem of the modern American libertarian orthodoxy. According to von Mises, a citizen must have economic freedom to be politically or morally free. And Ross wanted to be free.

    In the Good Wagon warehouse, Ross oversaw five part-time college students sorting, logging, and organizing the 50,000 books on shelves he built himself. That December was Good Wagon’s best month, clearing 10 grand.

    >

    But by the end of 2010, the new CEO of Good Wagon was looking beyond the book business. During his forays into trading, Ross had discovered bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency. The value of bitcoin—based only on market factors, unattached to any central bank—aligned with his advancing libertarian philosophy. On his LinkedIn page, Ross wrote that he wanted to “use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind.”

    Silk Road was an online Darknet Marketplace that operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users are able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. Launched in February 2011, it was the first modern Darknet Marketplace. Although Silk Road was an underground website, sometimes called the "Amazon.com of illegal drugs" or the "eBay for drugs," the site also sold apparel, art, biotic materials, books, collectibles, computer equipment, digital goods, along with dozens of other categories of merchandise.

As part of the dark web, it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. The website was launched in February 2011; development had begun six months prior. Initially there were a limited number of new seller accounts available; new sellers had to purchase an account in an auction. Later, a fixed fee was charged for each new seller account.

    [Traveling Down the Silk Road to Buy Drugs With Bitcoins](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qkkkwx/traveling-down-the-silkroad-to-buy-drugs-with-bitcoins)

    There simply must be a more dignified way to procure illegal substances.

        Silk Road cuts down on scams with a reputation-based trading system familiar to anyone who's used Amazon or eBay. The user Bloomingcolor appears to be an especially trusted vendor, specializing in psychedelics. One happy customer wrote on his profile: "Excellent quality. Packing, and communication. Arrived exactly as described." They gave the transaction five points out of five.

    >

    "Our community is amazing," Silk Road's anonymous administrator, known on forums as "Silk Road," told us in an e-mail. "They are generally bright, honest and fair people, very understanding, and willing to cooperate with each other."

    [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/silk-road-inside-the-21st-century-drug-bazaar-69982/](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/silk-road-inside-the-21st-century-drug-bazaar-69982/)

    It hasn’t happened yet, however, not even after Sen. Charles Schumer of New York demanded that the DEA take down Silk Road. “Never before has a website so brazenly peddled illegal drugs online,” Schumer announced this past summer. “By cracking down on the website, we can help stop these drugs from flooding our streets.” Problem is, the DEA can’t shut it down; due to the Tor network’s encryption, law enforcement doesn’t even know where to look. “Finding the body behind the servers, that’s the challenge,” admits DEA spokesman Rusty Payne. “Bad guys are certainly innovative and savvy when it comes to technology.” So for now, the deliveries continue.

    >

    *This story is from the November 10th, 2011 issue of Rolling Stone*

    [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/inrbo/iama_seller_on_the_illegal_anonymous_marketplace/c2582ti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/inrbo/iama_seller_on_the_illegal_anonymous_marketplace/c2582ti/)

    Look at the seller's description of the product. If they're very detailed, then they're probably more serious. If they give one sentence, they probably don't care as much.

    Look at the seller's own page. The address will look something like "[http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/1914](http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/1914)" (That's mine. The only difference will be the "1914", which is the unique number for me. Other sellers will have a different number there). Again, you want detail. They should say a bit about the kinds of products they sell, accepted payments, how to contact them, etc.

    >

    Check if they have a PGP key. If they don't have a PGP key, don't buy anything illegal from them. If somehow Silk Road's servers are seized (which is very unlikely), the authorities will be able to read ALL of the unencrypted information that's on the site. If you send your information in PGP, the authorities will NEVER be able to read that information unless they beat the passwords out of the seller.

    >

    There are people on Silk Road who are selling things on it that aren't illegal. Computers, Xboxes, iPods, jewelry, etc. There shouldn't be a need to use PGP with them.

    >

    Lastly, I realize that you already mentioned it, but look at their reviews. If they have four bad reviews and one brilliant review, then they made a fake account. If they have no reviews, wait for someone else to try it.

    >

    As one of the Silk Road admins put it, "DO NOT get comfortable! This is not wal-mart, or even amazon.com. It is the wild west and there are as many crooks as there are honest businessmen and women." Just be careful. Use common sense. Silk Road is perfectly safe is you look carefully and really try to find out if the seller is honest.

    To help balance against Bitcoin’s volatility, Dread Pirate Roberts introduced a “hedged escrow” option buyers and sellers in May 2011. For the rest of Silk Road’s lifespan, bitcoins were converted into U.S. dollars after a purchase, held in an escrow, and then changed back as the transaction was finalized, thus shielding both sides significantly from whatever currency volatility may creep up.

Both supporters of Silk Road’s particular brand of crypto-anarchic freedom and people concerned with Bitcoin’s public image can rest assured that Silk Road is nowhere near taking over the Bitcoin economy, but neither is it going away.

    In spring 2012, Nicolas Christin, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon university's cyber-security research centre, monitored activity on Silk Road for six months and estimated sales on the marketplace of £14.2m a year. Not bad for an 18-month-old start-up. "The total volume of sales was increasing quite significantly," said Christin, on the phone from his office in Pittsburgh. "The number of active sellers almost doubled over six months. So it definitely was growing. The numbers are probably even higher now."

However, this success for the US multi-agency task force (involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service, US Postal Inspection, Secret Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) does not mark the end of black markets hosted on the Tor network, or the availability of drugs anonymously bought online. Rather it spurred innovations in online illicit trading, underlining the hydra headed nature of ‘successful’ interdiction effort
