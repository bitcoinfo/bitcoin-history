    1997-09-14 - Notes from the Cypherpunks September Bay Area Meeting

    Here are some notes I took at the Cypherpunks September Bay Area Meeting on September 13 at "PGP World Headquarters" in San Mateo. Quotes are summaries and interpretations, but hopefullfy fair and accurate. My interpolations enclosed in square brackets. Cypherpunks meetings are not particularly formal, but more like a dialog between a number of people, punctuated with slightly more formal presentations.

    EH: The government now desires access to all plaintext communication.

    >

    Tim: The British, and OECD, trusted third party proposal is a nightmare: even if you have access to software such as PGP and Explorer that provides strong privacy, the British now regard the keys you need to use that technology as "crypto material" -- and it will be illegal to distribute unbreakable keys [presumably without license or escrow capabilities].

    >

    Vinnie Moscaritalo (Vinnie): Black market?

    >

    EH: No: there will be an underground market [the distinction is important] what we need are legitimate distribution of keys and crypto. Social pressure will otherwise keep crypto unused.

    >

    Tim: Quoting Whitfield Diffie: this is like the war on drugs. Ban crypto and companies will deutize themselves to assist the government just as they did by requiring urine tests.

    Drugs are freely available on nearly every inner city street corner. The "cat is out of the bag," as you say. And yet....

    >

    - the War on (Some) Drugs....

    - mandatory hard time for first offenses (ask the Santa Cruz kid doing 10 years without parole for possession of some amount of acid...the weight of the blotter paper kicked it up to the 10-year level)

    - civil forfeiture... "We find a roach, we get your yacht."

    - midnight raids, often killing innocent citizens (ask the Malibu retired guy who got zapped by the Feds...turns out they'd already greedily started to divvy up his land to various parks...and of course he was totally innocent--and now dead)

    - "D.A.R.E."-type brainwashing of children, encouraging them to turn in their parents

    >

    ...and so on. You should all know about these things, on this of all days (16 April 1943, 50 years ago, was the discovery of LSD).

    >

    Restricting crypto means the government has a big club they use to threaten, intimidate, force cooperation, etc. Just like with taxes, drugs, and everything else they control.

    >

    Under the civil forfeiture laws, my assets (which I depend on to live out the rest of my life on!!) could be seized if the government suspects I'm using "illegal crypto." Not under current laws, but certainly under the laws that follow from the "Clinton Clipper."

    >

    Anyone with assets to seize--a house, a business, a stock account--becomes a fair target.

    [https://www.athabascau.ca/courses/engl/491/cyberpunk_history.pdf](https://www.athabascau.ca/courses/engl/491/cyberpunk_history.pdf) Neuromancer made a big splash not because it was the "first" cyberpunk novel, but rather, because it perfectly captured the Zeitgeist of anxiety and wonder that prevailed at the dawning of the present era of globalized economics, digital telecommunications, and exponential technological progress --things which we now take for granted but which, in the early 1980s were still new and frightening. For example, Gibson's novels exhibit a fascination with the "Japanification" of Western culture --then a major concern, but now a forgotten and laughable anxiety. This is also visible in the futuristic Los Angeles of Scott’s Blade Runner.
