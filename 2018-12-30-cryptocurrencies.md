**ethereum history from Chris Burniskey's Cryptoassets** 
> In June 2014, Buterin received the Thiel Fellowship 14 as a 20-year-old dropping out of the University of Waterloo to pursue his inter- est in Ethereum on a full-time basis. 
>
> While Buterin may go down as one of Thiel’s greatest investments, Thiel wasn’t alone in recognizing the potential of Ethereum. In 2014, Buterin was given the World Technology Award in Information Technology Software, 15 alongside influential names such as Elon Musk in the Energy category and Walter Isaacson in Media & Journalism. While the Thiel Fellowship was an indication of what was to come for Buterin, $100,000 wasn’t enough to sustain his team. To that end, from July 23, 2014, to September 2, 2014, they staged a 42-day presale of ether, the crypto- commodity underlying the Ethereum network. 16 . 
>
>Ether was sold at a range of 1,337 to 2,000 ether per bitcoin, with 2,000 ether per bitcoin on offer for the first two weeks of the presale and then declining linearly toward 1,337 ether per bitcoin in the latter half of the sale, creating momentum by incentivizing people to buy in at the beginning. Overseeing the legal and financial nuances around this sale was the newly created Ethereum Foundation headquartered in Zug, Switzerland. 17 With the money they raised, the Ethereum team was also able to test the network before launch in a way that Satoshi and his small group of support- ers were not able to. Starting at the end of 2014 and for the first half of 2015, the Ethereum Foundation encouraged battle testing of its network, both in a grassroots bug bounty program and in formal security audits that involved professional third-party software security firms. 22

  > Contracts, which can send messages to each other, represent mutually-distrusting parties which nevertheless want to cooperate. The lessons of the object-capability community (starting with those presented in Mark Miller's thesis) are especially relevant. We anthropomorphise these programs, and say "they" wish to cooperate without exposing themselves to unnecessary risks.
