  > Try using bitcoins the next time you need to send or receive a payment over the Internet. First, download the Bitcoin software. Once Bitcoin is running, click 'Generate Coins' which will pay you bitcoins in exchange for your computer working to validate bitcoin transactions. Check the exchange rate to calculate how many bitcoins need to be sent. The payer can purchase additional bitcoins if needed. The payer's previously generated bitcoins allow for a lower out of pocket payment. The payer then sends the bitcoins to the receiver using the Bitcoin software. The receiver can then sell their bitcoins for dollars. The receiver's previously generated bitcoins allow a higher dollar payout.

* [An Analysis of Anonymity in the Bitcoin System](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~clark/biblio/bitcoin/Reid%25202011.pdf) - Fergal Reid University College Dublin, Ireland Martin Harrigan University College Dublin, Ireland
  > Anonymity in Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electroniccurrency system, is a complicated issue. Within the system,users are identified by public-keys only. An attacker wishingto de-anonymize its users will attempt to construct the one-to-many mapping between users and public-keys and associateinformation external to the system with the users. Bitcoinfrustrates this attack by storing the mapping of a user to hisor her public-keys on that user’s node only and by allowingeach user to generate as many public-keys as required. In thispaper we consider the topological structure of two networksderived from Bitcoin’s public transaction history. We showthat the two networks have a non-trivial topological structure,provide complementary views of the Bitcoin system and haveimplications for anonymity. We combine these structures withexternal information and techniques such as context discoveryand flow analysis to investigate an alleged theft of Bitcoins, which,at the time of the theft, had a market value of approximatelyhalf a million U.S. dollars.

I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!

He modeled the monetary supply as 4 gold mines being discovered per mibillenium (1024 years), with equal intervals between them, each one being depleted over the course of 140 years. This poses obvious problems, however. Prominent among them is the discussion on what to call 1 billion Bitcoin, which symbol color to use for it, and when wallet clients should switch to it by default. To combat this, this document proposes a controversial change: making Bitcoin's monetary supply finite."
