I used this space as prep for writing this article: 

* [The Times and History of Permissioned Ledgers](https://www.axiomtech.io/blog-feed/history-of-permissioned-ledgers)


## Source Crypto

I collect links in the SourceCrypto Discord Server [#history channel](https://discord.gg/SUatSjs), and occasionally I export them to this website:

* [https://infominer.id/SourceCrypto/discolog/general/history/](https://infominer.id/SourceCrypto/discolog/general/history/)

You can expect that page and the discord server to have information that isn't on this page, as exporting the contents of a discord server is faster than updating each page individually.



## Early use, and discussion of "Distributed Ledger" 

* [Decentralized Anonymous Credentials](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/622.pdf)
  >"Our approach builds on recent results in the area of electronic cash and uses techniques — such as [...] a distributed transaction ledger" and later they even use the words "distributed ledger" together but informally

  > This article argues, however, that the key innovation of digital currencies is the ‘distributed ledger’ which allows a payment system to operate in an entirely decentralised way, without intermediaries such as banks.

### Monax - Eris 

—the first open-source permissioned blockchain

I kinda lost where the following quote came from.. I think it was Preston Byrnes blog.. oops!

  >I’m into blockchains, having been a founder and former COO of [Monax](https://monax.io/). Monax built [the first](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/14/bitbeat-blockchains-without-coins-stir-tensions-in-bitcoin-community/) open-source permissioned blockchain client in 2014. The design has since evolved into the market-leading Hyperledger Burrow permissioned Ethereum blockchain node. Burrow is presently the Hyperledger Project’s only Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and is used by Intel and IBM’s contributions to that project, Sawtooth and Fabric, to run EVMs on those codebases. 


* $100,000 bounty [was announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/25sf4f/100000_bounty_for_software_platform_that_can/) for the creation of a software platform to replace the Bitcoin Foundation, out of concerns over a lack of transparency


* [https://prestonbyrne.com/2014/06/02/project-d/](prestonbyrne.com/2014/06/02/project-d/)
  > In response, Casey Kuhlman, Dennis McKinnon and Preston Byrne of Monax led an effort to create the worlds first Decentralized Autonomous Organization
* [https://prestonbyrne.com/2014/10/25/introducing-eris-industries/](prestonbyrne.com/2014/10/25/introducing-eris-industries/)
  - This became [Eris Industries](https://web.archive.org/web/20150213194226/https://erisindustries.com/), growing into an open-source [Distributed Application Software Stack](https://web.archive.org/web/20160411053017/https://blog.erisindustries.com/philosophy/2016/03/02/eris-and-tendermint/) including a distributed application server ([Decerver](https://web.archive.org/web/20150414200414/https://decerver.io/)), [ErisDB](https://web.archive.org/web/20151120220014/https://erisindustries.com/components/erisdb/),

They didn't win the bounty, but their open-source permissionable implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was submitted to the Hyperledger Foundation under the name [Burrow](https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/HIP_Burrowv2.pdf), and has helped any number of people and organizations experiment with a blockchain virtual machine.

## Evernym-Sovrin 

Around the same time, Evernym published its initial [identity white paper](https://www.evernym.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Identity-System-Essentials.pdf) and began its work on [Plenum], an implementation of RBFT consensus, supporting the development of a [decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf).

In September, the open-source Sovrin codebase was [donated to the Sovrin Foundation](http://www.windley.com/archives/2016/09/announcing_the_sovrin_foundation.shtml): a private-sector, international non-profit established to govern a global public utility for self-sovereign identity.


## Quorum 

10/2016, JP Morgan announced their development of Quorum, a permissioned version of Ethereum supporting data privacy to enable interaction between public and private blockchains and allowing for private, secure, peer-to-peer transactions.
