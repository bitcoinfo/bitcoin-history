excerpt: >
  The capability paradigm is about access control. When a system, such as an OS or a website, is presented with a request for a service it provides, it needs to decide if it should actually do what the requestor is asking for.

I was writing this basic introduction, [Smart Contracts: Use cases, and DApps](https://www.axiomtech.io/blog-feed/2018/10/9/smart-contracts-uses-cases-dapps-icos)
  >Smart contracts are self-executing code that defines and executes an agreement between multiple parties. That code contains simple “if/when…then…” statements executed within a distributed network that achieves consensus on transactions made within it.

When I came across:

* [lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/5003#comment-94645](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/5003#comment-94645) 
  * *A Next Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform* (Vitaliks ANN post on lambda-the-ultimate)
    > Smart contracts and related languages have a long discussion history on LtU
    
Which took me down the rabbithole and led to [the creation](https://github.com/sourcecrypto/bitcoin-history/commit/29700115d9c74eebb72b04023dd0085057e0ecd6#diff-cd3d4ba11ddc27e38cd09a3284beeb87) of this page.

## Bitcoin History Discord Chat

Previously I was tracking all my information in one discord server, but I realized I would need more.

Recently, I made a separate server just for [Bitcoin History](https://discord.gg/Evk84Kk). So you can find a ton of stuff there... and then there is the archive page from the original: [sourcecrypto.pub / smart-contracts](https://sourcecrypto.pub/archive/chaintech/smart-contracts/)

There is still much work to be done, and right now all my Bitcoin content is being gathered together and should make a formiddable resource, soon!

## Object Capabilities (ObCap)

The object-capability model was first proposed by Jack Dennis and Earl C. Van Horn in the 1966 paper.
* [Programming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations](https://www.princeton.edu/~rblee/ELE572Papers/Fall04Readings/ProgramSemantics_DennisvanHorn.pdf)
* [What Are Capabilities?](https://web.archive.org/web/20190423063056/http://habitatchronicles.com/2017/05/what-are-capabilities/)
  >The capability paradigm is about access control. When a system, such as an OS or a website, is presented with a request for a service it provides, it needs to decide if it should actually do what the requestor is asking for. The way it decides is what we’re talking about when we talk about access control. If you’re like most people, the first thing you’re likely to think of is to ask the requestor “who are you?” The fundamental insight of the capabilities paradigm is to recognize that this question is the first step on the road to perdition. That’s highly counterintuitive to most people, hence the related controversy.

## Mark S Miller

>Mark S. Miller is an American computer scientist. He is known for his work as one of the participants in the 1979 hypertext project known as Project Xanadu; for inventing Miller columns; as the co-creator of the Agoric Paradigm[1] of market-based distributed secure computing; and the open-source coordinator of the E programming language. He also designed the Caja programming language.

    >I'm always astounded by the depth to which Mark has explored this space. On more than a few occasions, I've come up with an interesting idea for a new protocol or programming language feature or piece of distributed systems infrastructure and told Mark about it, only to find he had already thought of that problem and discovered and solved several issues I hadn't even thought about yet.

    >(You can think of this design as an extension of the file descriptor table concept in Unix, except that both sides may export descriptors to the other side (so that calls can flow either way), and either side can be responsible for assigning the numeric descriptor value for any particular description (which makes it easier to compensate for a high-latency transport).)

## Colored Coins

* [Colored Coins - BitcoinX](http://bitpaper.info/paper/5722646637445120) - Vitalik Buterin, Meni Rosenfeld
  >By the original design bitcoins are fungible, acting as a neutral medium of exchange. However, by carefully tracking the origin of a given bitcoin, it is possible to "color" a set of bitcoins to distinguish it from the rest. These bitcoins can then have special properties supported by either an issuing agent or by public agreement, and have value independent of the face value of the underlying bitcoins. Such colored bitcoins can be used for alternative currencies, commodity certificates, smart property, and other financial instruments such as stocks and bonds. 
  >
  >Because colored coins make use of the existing Bitcoin infrastructure and can be stored and transferred without the need for a third party, and even be exchanged for one another in an atomic transaction, they can open the way for the decentralized exchange of things that are not possible by traditional methods. In this paper we will discuss the implementation details of colored coins and some of their use cases.

  >About a year and a half ago in autumn 2013, I was working as the lead developer with Vitalik Buterin (who later became the initiator of the Ethereum project) on another project with the name ‘Keidom’ (now called ascribe.io). The idea behind Keidom/Ascribe was to develop a custom colored-coin web-wallet for registering and transfering digital art in a secure way, based on the Bitcoin blockchain, with build-in proof-of-existence. We developed a working prototype during September and November 2013.

## Ethereum 

The short version is that Vitalik started Ethereum after a few attempts to integrate colored coins with Bitcoin.

And it kind of came over time.

  >The first thing I did was I made a proposal to Mastercoin that would replace basically five of the transaction types they have with a programming language designed to express financial contracts between two parties. So you could do binary options, contracts for different bets—
